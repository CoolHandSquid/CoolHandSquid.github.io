    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Tickets</h1><br/>In the realm of Kerberos authentication tickets come in the form of Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service Tickets (TGS). <br />Remember! When a user completes a login (AS_REQ and then AS_REP) the AS_REP contains a TGT for that user. The user will then use that TGT to make a TGS request (TGS_REQ) when trying to authenticate with an application server.<br /><br />In summary, if you are able to steal a TGS of another user you can authenticate to only the specified service as them. With a TGT you can legitamitly go through the TGS_REQ, TGS_REP, AP_REQ, and AP_REP process and authenticate to any application service that the original TGT had access to. </div></body></html>
