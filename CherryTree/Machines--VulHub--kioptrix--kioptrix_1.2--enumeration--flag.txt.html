Wasn&#39;t that bad now was it.<br /><br />Went in a different direction with this VM. Exploit based challenges are<br />nice. Helps workout that information gathering part, but sometimes we<br />need to get our hands dirty in other things as well.<br />Again, these VMs are beginner and not intented for everyone. <br />Difficulty is relative, keep that in mind.<br /><br />The object is to learn, do some research and have a little (legal)<br />fun in the process.<br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this third challenge.<br /><br />Steven McElrea<br />aka loneferret<br /><a href="http://www.kioptrix.com">http://www.kioptrix.com</a><br /><br /><br />Credit needs to be given to the creators of the gallery webapp and CMS used<br />for the building of the Kioptrix VM3 site.<br /><br />Main page CMS: <br /><a href="http://www.lotuscms.org">http://www.lotuscms.org</a><br /><br />Gallery application: <br />Gallarific 2.1 - Free Version released October 10, 2009<br /><a href="http://www.gallarific.com">http://www.gallarific.com</a><br />Vulnerable version of this application can be downloaded<br />from the Exploit-DB website:<br /><a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15891/">http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15891/</a><br /><br />The HT Editor can be found here:<br /><a href="http://hte.sourceforge.net/downloads.html">http://hte.sourceforge.net/downloads.html</a><br />And the vulnerable version on Exploit-DB here:<br /><a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17083/">http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17083/</a><br /><br /><br />Also, all pictures were taken from Google Images, so being part of the<br />public domain I used them.<br /><br />root@Kioptrix3:~# <br /></div></body></html>
