The  editorial team leads this process and will collect any document  supplied. To submit a document connect to the FTP server on port 21 using the  username: &quot;editor&quot; and the password &quot;MyEditWork&quot;.  Ensure that any documents are saved in the &quot;.doc&quot; or &quot;.docx&quot; format,  this will allow our editors to quickly go through the document and  perform editorial work’<br />The tester (Chris) confirmed that the FTP credentials were functional and that he was able to “put” to the server.<br />Chris used a msfvenom command to create a vbs script that he added to a macro on a word document named 443-167.docm.<br />He then uploaded the .docm file to the FTP server and recieved a reverse shell when the command was executed.<br />The shell he recieved was of alice/svcorp which allowed him to read the proof.txt file on the administrator desktop.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><code>#https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt</code><br /><br /><a href="https://m0chan.github.io/2019/07/30/Windows-Notes-and-Cheatsheet.html#-run-seatbelt-absolutely-must">https://m0chan.github.io/2019/07/30/Windows-Notes-and-Cheatsheet.html#-run-seatbelt-absolutely-must</a></div></body></html>
