As always, they are made for the beginner in <br />mind, and not meant for the seasoned pentester. However this does not mean one <br />can&#39;t enjoy them.<br /><br />As with all my VMs, besides getting &quot;root&quot; on the system, the goal is to also<br />learn the basics skills needed to compromise a system. Most importantly, in my mind,<br />are information gathering &amp; research. Anyone can throw massive amounts of exploits<br />and &quot;hope&quot; it works, but think about the traffic.. the logs... Best to take it<br />slow, and read up on the information you gathered and hopefully craft better<br />more targetted attacks. <br /><br />For example, this system is FreeBSD 9. Hopefully you noticed this rather quickly.<br />Knowing the OS gives you any idea of what will work and what won&#39;t from the get go.<br />Default file locations are not the same on FreeBSD versus a Linux based distribution.<br />Apache logs aren&#39;t in &quot;/var/log/apache/access.log&quot;, but in &quot;/var/log/httpd-access.log&quot;.<br />It&#39;s default document root is not &quot;/var/www/&quot; but in &quot;/usr/local/www/apache22/data&quot;.<br />Finding and knowing these little details will greatly help during an attack. Of course<br />my examples are specific for this target, but the theory applies to all systems.<br /><br />As a small exercise, look at the logs and see how much noise you generated. Of course<br />the log results may not be accurate if you created a snapshot and reverted, but at least<br />it will give you an idea. For fun, I installed &quot;OSSEC-HIDS&quot; and monitored a few things.<br />Default settings, nothing fancy but it should&#39;ve logged a few of your attacks. Look<br />at the following files:<br />/root/folderMonitor.log<br />/root/httpd-access.log (softlink)<br />/root/ossec-alerts.log (softlink)<br /><br />The folderMonitor.log file is just a cheap script of mine to track created/deleted and modified<br />files in 2 specific folders. Since FreeBSD doesn&#39;t support &quot;iNotify&quot;, I couldn&#39;t use OSSEC-HIDS <br />for this.<br />The httpd-access.log is rather self-explanatory .<br />Lastly, the ossec-alerts.log file is OSSEC-HIDS is where it puts alerts when monitoring certain<br />files. This one should&#39;ve detected a few of your web attacks.<br /><br />Feel free to explore the system and other log files to see how noisy, or silent, you were.<br />And again, thank you for taking the time to download and play.<br />Sincerely hope you enjoyed yourself.<br /><br />Be good...<br /><br /><br />loneferret<br /><a href="http://www.kioptrix.com">http://www.kioptrix.com</a><br /><br /><br />p.s.: Keep in mind, for each &quot;web attack&quot; detected by OSSEC-HIDS, by<br />default it would&#39;ve blocked your IP (both in hosts.allow &amp; Firewall) for<br />600 seconds. I was nice enough to remove that part :)<br /># <br /></div></body></html>
