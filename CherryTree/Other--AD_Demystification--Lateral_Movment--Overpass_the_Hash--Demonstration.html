    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Demonstration</h1><br/>This was run from Bossman (Windows 10) under the context of Squid (domain user) in an elevated command prompt.<br />We have dumped Tire&#39;s hash several times now, but in case you don&#39;t have it : 4A75E2A7EE6E92ACBC02692028A4EECF<br />Utilizing overpass the hash (pth in mimikatz), create a session running as squid but will allow us to run commands as Tire.<br />First I am going to show that I am a user with the 3 standard tickets, plus one more becasue this is run in a users elevated command prompt. Note that I am denied when I try to psexec to the DC.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-1.png" alt="images/1177-1.png" /></a><br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-2.png" alt="images/1177-2.png" /></a><br /><br />I then used mimikatz to create a TGT with the NTLM hash of Tire and then kick off a cmd prompt.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-3.png" alt="images/1177-3.png" /></a><br />In the new command prompt I showed that all of the previously cached tickets were gone (mimikatz-ism). What is really important about this is that just becasue we “successfully” created a TGT does not mean It will get me a TGS that will successfully authenticate to anything.<br />I then psexeced to the DC (which I was not able to do before).<br />After proving that I was on the DC I exited back to Bossman and checked my klist, noteing that there are cached tickets there now.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-4.png" alt="images/1177-4.png" /></a><br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-5.png" alt="images/1177-5.png" /></a><br />The NTLM hash was what we started with, and we ended with the TGT for a domain admin.<br /><br />Note- There was some minor hand of god that needed to be added to squids account to make this work. Not 100% as to why it was needed.<br /><a href=""><img src="images/1177-6.png" alt="images/1177-6.png" /></a></div></body></html>
