    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Overpass the Hash</h1><br/>Overpass the Hash is similar to Pass the Hash as they both utilize a compromised NTLM hash, but in Overpass the Hash we will take that compromised NTLM hash and turn it into a TGT (or TGS). If our created TGT is that of a domain admin, it will give us the ability to send a TGS_REQ to the KDC that will return a TGS_RES containing a TGS that will allow us to authenticate to servers as that user. </div></body></html>
