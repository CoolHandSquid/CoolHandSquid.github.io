Try and find them.<br />I&#39;ve only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t more.<br />As always there&#39;s an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.<br />Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.<br /><br />It took a while to make this. For one it&#39;s not as easy as it may look, and<br />also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.<br />Really hope you enjoyed this one.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t already, check out the other VMs available on:<br /><a href="http://www.kioptrix.com">www.kioptrix.com</a><br /><br />Thanks for playing,<br />loneferret<br /><br /></div></body></html>
