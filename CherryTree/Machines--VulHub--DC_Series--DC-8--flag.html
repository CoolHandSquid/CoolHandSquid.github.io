Just wanted to send a big thanks out there to all those<br />who have provided feedback, and all those who have taken the time to complete these little<br />challenges.<br /><br />I&#39;m also sending out an especially big thanks to:<br /><br />@4nqr34z<br />@D4mianWayne<br />@0xmzfr<br />@theart42<br /><br />This challenge was largely based on two things:<br /><br />1.
