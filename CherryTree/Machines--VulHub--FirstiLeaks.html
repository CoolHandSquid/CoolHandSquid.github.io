    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>FirstiLeaks</h1><br/>First I ran a nmap scan and it revealed that port 80 was open<br />Dirsearch and nikto both revealed nothing<br />after cheating I found that fristi was the login page (I was supposed to guess that)<br />In the source code of the page I found a base 64 encoded password<br />after putting it in cyber chef I realized it was still trash.<br />I then turned it into an image and BOOM creds.<br />eezeepz keKkeKKeKKeKkEkkEk<br />I was then able to upload a php reverse shell (pentestmonkey) named php-reverse-shell.php.png<br />start nc listener<br /><a href="http://192.168.11.139/fristi/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php.png">http://192.168.11.139/fristi/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php.png</a> and it was executed!<br />I was able to cd into /home/eezeepz and read notes.txt<br />It told me hat I could run files that started with /usr/bin/*<br />I could run things by echoing them into /tmp/runthis and it would be executed every minute<br />echo ‘/usr/bin/../../bin/chmod 777 /home/admin’ &gt; /tmp/runthis<br />now I can cd into /home/admin!<br />Here I saw a homemade script named cryptpass.py that would encrypt passwords.<br />(the encrypted password was in the same dir)<br />I wrote a decoder for the encoder and boom! fristigod creds!<br />su -l fristigod  and creds = we are now fristigod!!!!<br />sudo -l shows that we can run a cutom “doCom” as fristi (probably root)<br />sudo -u fristi /var/fristigod/.secret_admin_stuff/doCom chmod -R 777 /root <br />BOOM /root is open and the flag is readable!!</div></body></html>
