    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>10.11.1.20 SV-DC01</h1><br/>SVCORP-<br />Began enumeration on .20 externally via TmuxRecon. <br />There were no obvious avenues of attack so I moved on to .21.<br />Enumeration with TmuxRecon showed that there was an open web server which was hosting an html document giving the creds editor and MyEditWork to an FTP server on the same box.<br />After creating a .docm file with a rev shell macro, I uploaded it to the FTP server on .21 hoping that someone would open it and accept the macro.<br />I then got a rev shell to .22 as the local administrator alice in a medium integrity shell. <br />I used Akagi.exe 23 to turn that into a high integrity Shell.<br />I then used mimikatz sekurlsa to dump the logon passwords which gave me the cleartext password for alice, ThisIsTheUsersPassword01.<br />I then used Spray-Passwords.ps1 to guess passwords that were following the same pattern. By matter of chance, the numbers matched the order of how the users were in LDAP. ThisIsTheUsersPassword20 for adam ended up being pretty useful.<br />I then used psexec.py to use adams credentials to log on to .21. I then used mimikatz to dump the logonpasswords and wdigest. This got me the hash of tris.<br />I used psexec.py and tris&#39;s creds to log on to .20. <br />	psexec.py svcorp/tris@10.11.1.20 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee0:8df3c73ded940e1f2bcf5eea4b8dbf6 -dc-ip 10.11.1.20 <br />net use showed me that the admins were broken into &#39;Server Admins&#39; and &#39;Workstation Admins&#39;. I changed the password of pete (workstation admins) to Fr33d0M32. I then RDP&#39;d in as him and collected the last proof!<br /> <br /> </div></body></html>
