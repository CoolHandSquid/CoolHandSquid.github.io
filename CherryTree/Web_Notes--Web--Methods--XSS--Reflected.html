    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Reflected</h1><br/>In a reflected cross-site scripting attack, the malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website. The website includes this payload in response back to the user. To summarise, an attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload.<br />This might seem harmless as it requires the victim to send a request containing an attackers payload, and a user wouldn&#39;t attack themselves. However, attackers could trick the user into clicking their crafted link that contains their payload via social-engineering them via email..<br />Reflected XSS is the most common type of XSS attack.<br /><br />&lt;script&gt;alert(window.location.hostname)&lt;/script&gt;<br />#Will return the ip of the webserver (.pathname could also be useful)</div></body></html>
