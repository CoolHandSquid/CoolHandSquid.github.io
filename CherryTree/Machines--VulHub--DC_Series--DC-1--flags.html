    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>flags</h1><br/>flag1.txt       Every good CMS needs a config file - and so do you.<br /><br />flag2.txt       Brute force and dictionary attacks aren&#39;t the only ways to gain access (and you WILL need access). What can you do with these credentials?<br /><br />flag3.txt       Special PERMS will help FIND the passwd - but you&#39;ll need to -exec that command to work out how to get what&#39;s in the shadow.<br /><br />flag4.txt       Can you use this same method to find or access the flag in root? Probably. But perhaps it&#39;s not that easy.  Or maybe it is?<br /><br />thefianlflag.txt<br /><br />Well done!!!!<br /><br />Hopefully you&#39;ve enjoyed this and learned some new skills.<br /><br />You can let me know what you thought of this little journey<br />by contacting me via Twitter - @DCAU7 </div></body></html>
