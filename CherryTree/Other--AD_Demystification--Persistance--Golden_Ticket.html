    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Golden Ticket</h1><br/>Remember! When a user logs in, they are submitting a request for a TGT. When the user recieves the TGT it is incrypted with the hash of the password for the krbtgt account. If we are able to get our hands on that password hash, we will be able to create our own TGT&#39;s, for users that exist or don&#39;t exist, and give them whatever privileges we desire!<br />The loss of the krbtgt hash is particularly devistating becasue there is no built in way to change the the krbtgt password. It can not be done without substancial downtime of the entire domain.</div></body></html>
